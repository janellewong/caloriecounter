# Calorie Counter

## Description


**What will the application do?**

 - Record the food you eat every day into 3 categories: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner 
 - When a person uses this app, it will ask for them to log down what they ate, as well as 
 how much of that foods they ate, and how many calories it has. 
 For example, one log could be *Skim Milk, 500 mL, 120 calories*. 
 - Total the calories for each meal as well as for the whole day
 - Set a calorie limit goal for the week, and know when that limit is breached
 
 
 **Who will use it?**
 
 Those who want to track what they eat will use this application. 
 This includes those on a diet, or those who want to control their calorie intake

 **Why is this project of interest to me?**
 
 I am interested in making this project because one of the goals for this quarantine
 season is to lose a few pounds, as well as develop healthier eating habits.
 I believe that an application like this one will help me keep track of what I am eating
 and help me go on a diet.
